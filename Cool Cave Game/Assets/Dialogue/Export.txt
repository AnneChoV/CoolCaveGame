#SAY.Flowchart.7.Millie
Shit!

#SAY.Flowchart.16.Florie
What was that?

#SAY.Flowchart.2.Kevin
The ceiling seems to have collapsed. Is anyone hurt?

#SAY.Flowchart.19.Florie
Yeah I'm okay, I think.

#SAY.Flowchart.1.Millie
I'm fine bro, are you?

#SAY.Flowchart.12.Kevin
I'm not hurt either.

#SAY.Flowchart.13.Millie
I can't see anything in here.

#SAY.Flowchart.17.Florie
It's so dark.

#SAY.Flowchart.20.Florie
Oh god, we're gonna die!

#SAY.Flowchart.22.Millie
Get it together, Florie. There's gotta be a way out of here.

#SAY.Flowchart.21.Florie
I guess there's a little bit of light in here at least.

#SAY.Flowchart.15.Kevin
Look, there's a gap up in the wall!

#SAY.Flowchart.14.Millie
Kevin, think you can climb through that gap?

#SAY.Flowchart.18.Kevin
Unlikely. Perhaps Florie can?

#SAY.Flowchart.25.Florie
I'm not sure if I can..

#SAY.Flowchart.24.Millie
Get your tiny ass up there!

#SAY.Flowchart.23.Florie
OW!

#SAY.Flowchart.10.Kevin
What happened?

#SAY.Flowchart.26.Florie
Millie pushed me!

#SAY.Flowchart.27.Florie
I don't think I can fit. Sorry guys.

#SAY.Flowchart.28.Kevin
Don't worry about it. We'll stay here for a bit then.

#SAY.Flowchart.29.Kevin
You know, I saw this documentary last weekend about camping out in the wild! This is just like that.

#SAY.Flowchart.30.Millie
Oh. Great.

#SAY.Flowchart.31.Florie
Really!? So what do we do now?

#SAY.Flowchart.32.Kevin
First, we need fire, of course!

#SAY.Flowchart.33.Florie
Fire, got it.

#SAY.Flowchart.34.Millie
How are we supposed to do that?

#SAY.Flowchart.35.Kevin
Well, we need to find wood. And then-

#SAY.Flowchart.36.Millie
Kevin, check my bag.

#SAY.Flowchart.37.Kevin
What? Why?

#SAY.Flowchart.38.Millie
Just do it dude.

#SAY.Flowchart.39.Kevin
Clever, you brought a lighter.

#SAY.Flowchart.40.Florie
Whoaah! Where did you get that?

#SAY.Flowchart.41.Millie
I took it from my dad's room. He didn't even notice!

#SAY.Flowchart.42.Florie
That's so cool!

#SAY.Flowchart.43.Kevin
Now we just need some wood.

#SAY.Flowchart.44.Millie
I don't see any wood around here.

#SAY.Flowchart.45.Kevin
No, but there was a storm last week. Some wood might have washed down further into the cave.

#SAY.Flowchart.46.Florie
Guys, I found a gap back here! I think the cave goes further inwards.

#SAY.Flowchart.48.Florie
I think I can crawl through and try to find some wood!

#SAY.Flowchart.49.Millie
Fine. But you better be careful, cuz I'm not squeezing through to save you.

#SAY.Flowchart.47.Florie
I'll be fine! I'll be back soon!
