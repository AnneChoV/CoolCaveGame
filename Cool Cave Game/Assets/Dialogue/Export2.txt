#SAY.Flowchart.8.Millie
Shit!

#SAY.Flowchart.17.Florie
What was that?

#SAY.Flowchart.18.Kevin
The ceiling seems to have collapsed. Is anyone hurt?

#SAY.Flowchart.20.Florie
Yeah I'm okay, I think.

#SAY.Flowchart.21.Millie
I'm fine bro, are you?

#SAY.Flowchart.22.Kevin
I'm not hurt either.

#SAY.Flowchart.23.Millie
I can't see anything in here.

#SAY.Flowchart.24.Florie
It's so dark.

#SAY.Flowchart.25.Florie
Oh god, we're gonna die!

#SAY.Flowchart.26.Millie
Get it together Florie! There's gotta be a way out of here.

#SAY.Flowchart.27.Florie
I guess there's a little bit of light in here at least.

#SAY.Flowchart.28.Kevin
Look, there's a gap up in the wall!

#SAY.Flowchart.29.Millie
Kevin, think you can climb through that gap?

#SAY.Flowchart.30.Kevin
Unlikely. Perhaps Florie can?

#SAY.Flowchart.31.Florie
I'm not sure if I can..

#SAY.Flowchart.32.Millie
Get your tiny ass up there!

#SAY.Flowchart.33.Florie
OW!

#SAY.Flowchart.34.Kevin
What happened?

#SAY.Flowchart.35.Florie
Millie pushed me!

#SAY.Flowchart.36.Florie
I don't think I can fit. Sorry guys.

#SAY.Flowchart.37.Kevin
Don't worry about it. We'll stay here for a bit then.

#SAY.Flowchart.38.Kevin
You know, I saw this documentary last weekend about camping out in the wild! This is just like that.

#SAY.Flowchart.39.Millie
Oh. Great.

#SAY.Flowchart.40.Florie
Really!? So what do we do now?

#SAY.Flowchart.41.Kevin
First, we need fire, of course!

#SAY.Flowchart.42.Florie
Fire, got it.

#SAY.Flowchart.43.Millie
How are we supposed to do that?

#SAY.Flowchart.44.Kevin
Well, we need to find wood. And then-

#SAY.Flowchart.45.Millie
Kevin, check my bag.

#SAY.Flowchart.46.Kevin
What? Why?

#SAY.Flowchart.47.Millie
Just do it dude.

#SAY.Flowchart.48.Kevin
Clever, you brought a lighter.

#SAY.Flowchart.49.Florie
Whoaah! Where did you get that?

#SAY.Flowchart.50.Millie
I took it from my dad's room. He didn't even notice!

#SAY.Flowchart.51.Florie
That's so cool!

#SAY.Flowchart.52.Kevin
Now we just need some wood.

#SAY.Flowchart.53.Millie
I don't see any wood around here.

#SAY.Flowchart.54.Kevin
No, but there was a storm last week. Some wood might have washed down further into the cave.

#SAY.Flowchart.55.Florie
Guys, I found a gap back here! I think the cave goes further inwards.

#SAY.Flowchart.56.Florie
I think I can crawl through and try to find some wood!

#SAY.Flowchart.57.Millie
Fine. But you better be careful, cuz I'm not squeezing through to save you.

#SAY.Flowchart.58.Florie
I'll be fine! I'll be back soon!

#SAY.Flowchart.61.Florie
I found some wood guys!

#SAY.Flowchart.62.Kevin
Neat. We can start a fire then.

#SAY.Flowchart.64.Millie
About time! We were starting to freeze.

#SAY.Flowchart.65.Kevin
We found some wood now and that's all that matters. For now.

#SAY.Flowchart.66.Millie
For now?! When are we getting out of this stupid place.

#SAY.Flowchart.63.Florie
Yeah I'm okay, I think.

#SAY.Flowchart.67.Florie
It's so dark.

#SAY.Flowchart.71.Kevin
Look, there's a gap up in the wall!

#SAY.Flowchart.69.Millie
Get it together Florie! There's gotta be a way out of here.
